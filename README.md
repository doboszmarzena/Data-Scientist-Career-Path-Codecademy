## 1. U.S. Medical Insurance Costs:

**Description**:

**For this project, I investigated a medical insurance costs dataset in a .csv file using the Python skills. I wrote my code in Jupyter Notebook:**

• I found out the average age of the patients in the dataset.

• I analyzed where a majority of the individuals are from.

• I looked at the different costs between smokers vs. non-smokers.

• I figuerd out what the average age is for someone who has at least one child in this dataset.
